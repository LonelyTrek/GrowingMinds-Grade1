# 🕵️‍♀️ Review & Git Workflow Guide

## 1. Review Checklist (The "Todo List")
Use this checklist to verify the recent changes. You can tick these off as you go.

### 📂 New Structure
- [ ] **AI Prompts (`05-AI-Prompts/`)**:
    - Check `math-tutor.md`: Is the "Bruner" style clear?
    - Check `logic-master.md`: Do the puzzle types make sense?
- [ ] **Templates (`templates/`)**:
    - Check `daily-log-template.md`: Is it easy to copy-paste?
    - Check `weekly-plan-template.md`: Does it fit your planning flow?
- [ ] **Documentation**:
    - Check `README.md`: Is the new "AI-Assisted Learning" section helpful?

### 📝 Content Refactor
- [ ] **Daily Log (`Week12-Routine/daily-log.md`)**:
    - Preview the file. Does the new formatting (icons, bold text, quotes) look better?
    - Verify the AI attribution comments `<!-- Generated by ... -->` are correct.

## 2. Git Workflow Options (Best Practices)

Since you are managing a personal educational project, here are the two best ways to handle these changes:

### Option A: The "Solo Developer" Flow (Simple & Fast)
*Best if you are the only one editing and want to save progress quickly.*

1.  **Review**: Look through the files using the checklist above.
2.  **Stage**: `git add .` (Add all changes)
3.  **Commit**: `git commit -m "feat: add AI prompts and templates"`
4.  **Push**: `git push origin main` (Sync to GitHub)

### Option B: The "Pull Request" Flow (Professional & Safe)
*Best if you want to simulate a team environment or carefully review changes before making them "official".*

1.  **Create Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/ai-enhancements`
2.  **Commit**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: add AI prompts and templates"
    ```
3.  **Push Branch**: `git push origin feature/ai-enhancements`
4.  **Create PR**: Go to GitHub, open a "Pull Request" from `feature/ai-enhancements` to `main`.
5.  **Review on GitHub**: Use GitHub's file comparison UI to see exactly what changed.
6.  **Merge**: Click "Squash and Merge" when satisfied.

### 💡 Recommendation
For this specific update (adding new folders and templates), **Option A** is sufficient and efficient.
However, if you want to practice "Code Review", **Option B** gives you the best interface to see the "Before vs After".
