# 📚 The Arsenal: Theoretical Foundations (理论军火库)

This project is not just a collection of worksheets; it is an applied experiment in cognitive science. Below are the core texts that drive our methodology.

本项目不仅仅是习题集，而是一场应用认知科学的教育实验。以下是驱动我们方法论的核心著作。

## 🧠 Meta-Learning & Strategy (元学习与策略)

### *The 4-Hour Chef* by Tim Ferriss
> **Core Concept**: DiSSS (Deconstruction, Selection, Sequencing, Stakes)
> **Application**:
> *   **Deconstruction**: Breaking down "Math" into atomic skills (Number Sense, Spatial, Logic).
> *   **Selection**: Focusing on the "Minimum Effective Dose" (e.g., skipping rote calculation if the concept is mastered).
> *   **Sequencing**: Why we teach "visualizing 10" before "writing 10".

### *Mindset: The New Psychology of Success* by Carol S. Dweck
> **Core Concept**: Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset
> **Application**:
> *   **Praise Effort, Not Intelligence**: In our `daily-log.md`, we record *how* they solved it, not just if they got it right.
> *   **The Power of "Yet"**: "You don't understand subtraction *yet*."

## ⚡ Cognitive Science (认知科学)

### *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman
> **Core Concept**: System 1 (Fast/Intuitive) vs. System 2 (Slow/Analytical)
> **Application**:
> *   **Fluency Trap**: When a child answers instantly (System 1), it might mean the task is too easy (`#Fluency`). We need to push them into System 2 (`#ZoneOfProximal`) where real learning happens.
> *   **Cognitive Strain**: Designing puzzles that force them to stop and think.

### *Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning* by Peter C. Brown et al.
> **Core Concept**: Active Retrieval, Spaced Repetition, Interleaving
> **Application**:
> *   **Interleaving**: We mix Logic, Geometry, and Arithmetic in one week, rather than doing "Math Month".
> *   **Retrieval**: The "I Am the Teacher" activity on Fridays forces the child to retrieve and explain knowledge, which is stronger than re-reading.

## 📝 Academic Papers & Research (学术论文与研究)

We bridge classic theories with cutting-edge cognitive science findings (2020-2025).

### 🏛️ The Foundations (经典基石)

*   **Bruner, J. S. (1966)**. *Toward a Theory of Instruction*.
    *   **Relevance**: The source of our **CPA (Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract)** framework. Modern research confirms that "Enactive" learning (physical manipulation) is crucial for bridging the gap to abstract symbols in Grade 1.
*   **Polya, G. (1945)**. *How to Solve It*.
    *   **Relevance**: The father of modern problem-solving. We use his "4-Step Process" (Understand -> Plan -> Carry out -> Look back) as the skeleton for our AI Logic Tutor.

### 🔬 Modern Consensus (前沿共识 2020-2025)

#### 1. Spatial Reasoning is the Hidden Key (空间推理是隐藏钥匙)
*   **Key Finding**: Recent meta-analyses (2020-2024) show a consistent, moderate-to-strong correlation ($r \approx 0.36$) between spatial skills and math achievement.
*   **Application**: We explicitly train **Mental Rotation** and **Visualization** (e.g., "The Hungry Rabbit" place value house) because spatial skills transfer directly to number line estimation and arithmetic strategy.
*   *Ref: Gilligan-Lee et al. (2020); Hawes et al. (2022).*

#### 2. Metacognition Starts Early (元认知起步更早)
*   **Key Finding**: Contrary to old beliefs, children as young as 5-7 can engage in "thinking about thinking". Self-monitoring (e.g., "Am I sure?") is a strong predictor of academic resilience.
*   **Application**: Our Friday **"I Am the Teacher"** session is designed to trigger this. By explaining *how* they solved a problem, they move from passive execution to active monitoring.
*   *Ref: Marulis et al. (2020); Bryce et al. (2021).*

#### 3. The "Golden Window" for Number Sense (数感黄金窗口)
*   **Key Finding**: The period between ages 5-8 is critical for developing "Conceptual Subitizing" (seeing numbers as groups) rather than just counting one-by-one.
*   **Application**: We prioritize **"Making Tens" (凑十法)** and **"Decomposition" (拆数)** over rote memorization of multiplication tables in Grade 1.
*   *Ref: Jordan et al. (2022).*
