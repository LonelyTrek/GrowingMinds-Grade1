Story: A rabbit eats 36 carrots in the morning. It eats 25 carrots in the afternoon. How many carrots did it eat in total?  
(题目: 36+25=?)    
    Step 1: Stack them up! (竖起来看)    
Let's look at the Ones place first: 6 and 5.  
    Step 2: Make a Ten (凑个整)    
    6+5= 11
    We keep the 1 in the Ones place.
    We send the big 10 to the Tens place (Carry over the 1).
    Step 3: Add the Tens (加十位)    
    You have 3 and 2.

    Step 1: Look at the Ones (看个位)  
    We have 2, and we want to take away 8.
    Wait! We can't do 2-8. 2 is too small! 😱
    Step 2: Borrow from a Ten (向十位借一)  
    Let's take 1 ten from 40. Now the 40 becomes 30.
    Give that 10 to the 2. Now the 2 becomes 12!
