# 🌿 The Wild Classroom: A Guide to Outdoor Inquiry

> "Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better." — Albert Einstein

## 1. Philosophy: Why Outdoor? (为什么去户外)
### 🧠 Attention Restoration Theory (注意力恢复理论)
Modern schooling demands intense "Directed Attention" (focusing on math/reading), which depletes cognitive resources. Nature provides "Soft Fascination" (clouds, leaves), which allows the brain to recharge.
*   **Goal**: We go outside not just to "play", but to **restore executive function** for next week's learning.

### 🌍 Situated Cognition (情境认知)
Learning happens best in authentic contexts.
*   **Classroom**: "A leaf has veins." (Abstract)
*   **Outdoors**: "Look! This leaf's veins feel like a net, but that one feels like lines!" (Concrete/Enactive)

## 2. Methodology: The OWC Cycle (方法论)
We use the **OWC Cycle** to structure our outdoor time. We are NOT just hiking; we are **Scientists in the Field**.

### Step 1: Observe (观察)
*   **Tool**: Magnifying glass, Binoculars.
*   **Action**: Stop walking. Look closely at ONE thing for 60 seconds.
*   **Prompt**: "I notice..." (我注意到...)

### Step 2: Wonder (提问)
*   **Action**: Ask a question that cannot be answered immediately.
*   **Prompt**: "I wonder..." (我好奇...)
*   *Example*: "I wonder why this tree has moss only on one side?"

### Step 3: Collect (收集/记录)
*   **Tool**: Camera, Sketchbook, Ziploc bag (for fallen items only).
*   **Action**: Document the finding.
*   **Prompt**: "It reminds me of..." (它让我想起...)

## 3. Safety & Ethics (安全与伦理)
1.  **Leave No Trace**: Take only photos (and fallen leaves), leave only footprints.
2.  **Hazard Check**: Watch out for thorns, insects, and slippery paths.
3.  **Respect**: Do not disturb living creatures.
